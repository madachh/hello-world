# hello-world
This repository consists of a project written in Python,
which generates a new word out of a palindrome word.
The project is made out of two defined functions that
detect whether the user's input word is a palindrome
and further makes the new word out of it. There is also
a main function in the project, which uses both of the
sub-functions.
